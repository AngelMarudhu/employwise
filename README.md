React User Management App

ðŸš€ Live Demo

Deployed On Netlify:

# Project Overview

This is a React-based user management application that interacts with the Reqres API includes authentication user listing and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and filtering functionality for admins for optimizing we've used React Router for navigation and Redux for state management and lazy loading for better performance and debounce function for optimizing the search functionality

# Featues

1. User Authentication (Login with API authentication)

2. User List (Paginated list of users from API)

3. Edit User (Update user details via API)

4. Delete User (Remove user via API)

5. Search & Filtering (Client-side search by first name) Bonus Features

6. State Management (Redux Toolkit used for managing global state)

7. Error Handling and Validation (Handles API failures gracefully)

8. Persisted Login (Token stored in local storage for session management)

9. Routing (Navigation between Login, User List, and Edit User pages)

10. Deployment (Hosted on Netlify)
